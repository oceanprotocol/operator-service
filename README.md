## About

The Operator Service is a micro-service implementing part of the Ocean Protocol
[Compute to the Data OEP-12](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/12#infrastructure-orchestration),
in charge of managing the workflow executing requests.
Typically the Operator Service is integrated from the [Brizo proxy](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo),
but can be called independently if it.

The Operator Service is in charge of stablishing the communication with the K8s cluster, allowing to:

* Register workflows as K8s objects
* List the workflows registered in K8s
* Stop a running workflow execution
* Get information about the state of execution of a workflow

The Operator Service doesn't provide any storage capability, all the state is stored directly in the K8s cluster.

## Getting Started

### Local Environment

The operator service is in charge of receiving the requests for running compute workflows and the
setup of those in the K8s infrastructure.
To do that, in a local environment the operator service needs connectivity to you K8s environment.

There are multiple configurations and deployments of K8s possible, but here we are going to show
how to connect to an existing K8s cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

#### Installing AWS & K8s tools

First is necessary to install the AWS CLI:

```
$ sudo pip3 install awscli --upgrade

$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.16.225 Python/3.7.3 Linux/5.0.0-25-generic botocore/1.12.215

```

You need to install the `aws-iam-authenticator`

```
$ curl -o aws-iam-authenticator https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.13.7/2019-06-11/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator
chmod +x ./aws-iam-authenticator
```
And later the Kubectl tool:

```
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

At this point, running `kubectl version` will output the installed version, but if you do not have a running cluster, then it will show a warning.

To run a cluster, there are various options. One of them is to install `minikube`. The instructions may differ (see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) but it should look something like this:

```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

Run `minikube start` taking care not to be in a root account.

Check your setup by running `kubectl config view` and inspecting the output. It should match your configured cluster(s).

You can find complete tutorials and docs for all these tools:

* https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html
* https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/


#### Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL database

The service also depends on postgresql, so make sure you install the dependencies e.g. `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev` in Ubuntu.
Create a database and configure the environment variables per your configuration, e.g.:

```
export POSTGRES_USER=myuser
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
export POSTGRES_DB=mydb
```

When running the Operator Service server for the first time, you will have to perform a database initialisation.
For that purpose, configure an Admin secret as an environment variable:

```
export ALLOWED_ADMINS=["myAdminSecret"]
```

#### Running the Service

In the project directory, create a virtual environment (if you don't have it already), activate it and install the dependencies (just once).

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Once you have Kubectl able to connect you your K8s cluster and Python dependencies installed, simply run the service:

```
export FLASK_APP=operator_service/run.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 8050
```

If it is your first time running the Operator Service server, you need to initialise the PostgreSQL database. You only have to do this once.
With the service running, set the "Admin" header to an allowed Admin secret, and use curl or Python to perform the pgsqlinit request.
Here is an example with Python:

```
import requests
headers = {"Admin": "myAdminSecret"}
requests.post(f"{API_URL}/pgsqlinit", headers=headers)
```

This will create the database structure needed by the service endpoints.

Having the server running you can find the complete Swagger API documentation here:

```
http://0.0.0.0:8050/api/v1/docs/
```

And check some of the API functions like the create or the list of the existing workflow executions:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8050/api/v1/operator/list" -H "accept: application/json"
["9f9178dcffd34130a3158ce9ca3d15ff"]
```


### ENV Vars

     ALGO_POD_TIMEOUT  = the maximum amount of time in seconds that an algorithm can use before it is killed
     STORAGE_EXPIRY = the maximum amount of time in seconds to store the job files outputs
     POSTGRES_DB = Postgres database
     POSTGRES_USER = Postgresql user
     POSTGRES_PASSWORD = Postgresql password
     POSTGRES_HOST = Postgresql host
     POSTGRES_PORT = Postgresql port
     SIGNATURE_REQUIRED = 0 -> no signature required, 1 -> request brizo signature
     ALLOWED_PROVIDERS = Json array with allowed providers that can access the endpoints
     ALLOWED_ADMINS = Array with allowed admins that can access the admin routes.
     OPERATOR_ADDRESS = Address used by Compute environment (IMPORTANT: Corresponding private key must be set in operator-engine env)
     DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = namespace which will run the jobs
     X-API-KEY = if defined, when downloading a compute output, will add X-API-KEY header (used for IPFS auth)
     CLIENT-ID = if defined, when downloading a compute output, will add CLIENT-ID header (used for IPFS auth)
     LOG_CFG and LOG_LEVEL = define the location of the log file and logging level, respectively

### Testing

Automatic tests are set up via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

### New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps bump the project version. You can execute the script using `{major|minor|patch}` as first argument, to bump the version accordingly.
